        </div>

        <h2 id="how-to-request">How to request deletion</h2>

        <ol>

          <li>Send the email to: <a href="mailto:thomas@tech4art.info">thomas@tech4art.info</a></li>
          <li>Use the subject line: <strong>Data Deletion Request — Odyssée / The Art Companion</strong></li>
          <li>In the body of the email, clearly state that you wish to delete your account and provide the <strong>email address associated with your Odyssée (The Art Companion) account</strong> that you want deleted. This is necessary for us to identify and process the correct account.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We will process verified requests within 30 days.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-deleted">What data is deleted</h2>
        <p>Upon verification of your deletion request, the following data associated with your account will be permanently deleted:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your <strong>Firebase Authentication record</strong>, including your login email and authentication credentials (password hash or linked Google account ID).</li>
          <li>Your <strong>User Entitlements record</strong> stored in our database (the list of tours you have purchased access to, linked to your user ID).</li>
          <li>Any other <strong>directly identifiable user profile data</strong> you may have provided (e.g. display name, saved preferences linked to your account, if applicable).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="what-may-be-retained">What data may be retained</h2>
        <p>Please note that certain data may be retained after account deletion:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Anonymized usage data:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized usage data collected via Firebase Analytics (Google Analytics for Firebase) helps us understand app usage patterns and improve the app. This data is not linked to your specific deleted account.</li>
          <li><strong>Purchase transaction records:</strong> Records of any purchases made through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store are maintained by Google and Apple respectively, according to their policies. RevenueCat (our purchase management provider) may also retain anonymized transaction data as required for financial reporting. This retained data does not include your direct account identifiers once deleted from our systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Crash reports:</strong> Anonymized crash reports collected via Firebase Crashlytics, which help us fix bugs, may be retained but are not linked to your deleted account.</li>
