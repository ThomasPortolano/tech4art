      <section class="section" aria-labelledby="problem">
        <h2 id="problem">Why visiting the Louvre can be challenging</h2>

        <h3>Too many rooms and artworks for a single visit</h3>
        <p>
          Even with several hours on site, it is impossible to see everything without a guiding thread.
        </p>

        <h3>Lack of context to understand what you are looking at</h3>
        <p>
          The artworks are extraordinary, but without a narrative, their meaning can quickly fade.
        </p>

        <h3>Traditional audio guides often feel like checklists</h3>
        <p>
          One artwork after another, with little connection or overarching perspective.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="how-it-works" aria-labelledby="how">
        <h2 id="how">How Odyssée works</h2>
        <p>
          Odyssée is designed around the real conditions of visiting the Louvre.
        </p>

        <h3>Choose a starting point or a theme</h3>
        <p>
          An iconic artwork, a civilisation, or a route designed for a specific part of the museum.
        </p>

        <h3>Listen to short, narrative sequences</h3>
        <p>
          Stories crafted to be heard inside the museum, without interrupting the visit.
        </p>

        <h3>Follow the links between artworks</h3>
        <p>
          Each sequence naturally leads to other artworks, connected through space, history, or ideas.
        </p>

        <h3>Works offline once inside the museum</h3>
        <p>
          Content is available offline, allowing you to listen freely even without a network connection.
        </p>

        <h3>Continue after the visit, at your own pace</h3>
        <p>
          The tours remain accessible. You can revisit, explore, and listen again from home, long after your visit.

      <section class="section" aria-labelledby="tours">
        <h2 id="tours">Three audio tours designed as narratives</h2>
        <p>Odyssée currently offers three curated routes at the Louvre.</p>
        <p>
          Each is conceived as a continuous experience, where artworks converse from one chapter to the next,
          forming a coherent story throughout the visit.
        </p>

        <h3>Masterpieces of Ancient Egypt</h3>
        <p>
          This tour spans more than three millennia of Egyptian civilisation through statues, reliefs,
          and ritual objects. Anchored by iconic works such as the Seated Scribe, the narrative extends to
          lesser-known pieces — the Relief of Seti I and Hathor or the statue of Senusret III —
          to explore power, religion, and representations of the body, and to understand how the Egyptians
          conceived time, death, and eternity.
        </p>

        <h3>Treasures of the Denon Wing</h3>
        <p>
          This tour approaches the Denon Wing as a sequence of great visual narratives.
          Around iconic masterpieces such as the Winged Victory of Samothrace, it reconsiders more complex works —
          The Raft of the Medusa, ancient reliefs — to reveal how artists have staged drama, glory,
          and power across centuries.
        </p>

        <h3>Encounters with the Italian Masters of the Renaissance</h3>
        <p>
          From Leonardo to Raphael, this tour explores the Italian Renaissance as a moment of transformation.
          Alongside universally known masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa, it invites listeners to pause before
          lesser-known works — The Madonna of the Meadow, The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne —
          to understand how artists experimented, hesitated, and reshaped their way of seeing the world.

            No. Odyssée is an independent application designed to accompany visits to the Louvre through
            narrative audio tours. It is neither affiliated with nor operated by the Louvre Museum.

            No. Odyssée offers a complementary approach focused on storytelling, connections between artworks,
            and the visitor experience. The official Louvre website and audio guide provide institutional
            and documentary information.
